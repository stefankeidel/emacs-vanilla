* About

  This is an Emacs configuration file written in [[http://orgmode.org][Org mode]]. It is an attempt to
  keep my =~/.emacs.d= tidy, but still be able to keep it all in one file. I
  aim to briefly explain all my configurations as I go along!

* Meta

  I want lexical scoping for the init-file, which can be specified in the
  header. The first line of the configuration is as follows:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;;; -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

  #+end_src

  The =init.el= should (after the first run) mirror the source blocks in the
  =init.org=. We can use =C-c C-v t= to run =org-babel-tangle=, which extracts
  the code blocks from the current file into a source-specific file (in this
  case a =.el=-file).

  To avoid doing this each time a change is made we can add a function to the
  =after-save-hook= ensuring to always tangle and byte-compile the
  =org=-document after changes.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp

    (defun tangle-init ()
      "If the current buffer is init.org the code-blocks are
    tangled, and the tangled file is compiled."
      (when (equal (buffer-file-name)
                   (expand-file-name (concat user-emacs-directory "init.org")))
        ;; Avoid running hooks when tangling.
        (let ((prog-mode-hook nil))
          (org-babel-tangle)
          (byte-compile-file (concat user-emacs-directory "init.el")))))

    (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'tangle-init)

  #+end_src
